# GIS-icons ![GIS-icons](https://github.com/Cracert/GIS-icons/blob/master/24x24/layer.png)

GIS icons theme is designed mainly for GIS applications. 
I hope it will help in intuitive visual identification of typical objects and actions. 
It is intended to be open and free alternative for existing GIS icon sets.

Design was inspired mainly by [Tango Desktop Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_Desktop_Project). 
I was impressed by beauty and simplicity of this design and tried to follow Tango guidelines. 
I hope to get close to this level in version 7.0 :)
